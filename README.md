# Pattern library critiques

## Overview

Select 3 of your peers and get them to [critique your pattern library ➔](/courses/shared/peer-evaluation/)

Also consider performing [usability tests ➔](topics/usability-testing-checklist/)

**Try to get feedback on improving your patterns, making them more usable—and wonderful**

*Record the feedback as Issues in GitHub attached to your `portfolio` repo so they can be tracked & followed up on.*

This is part of the “Hand-in” component of the pattern library itself. You can either do it this week or next week but it must be done.
